# Python Template Repository

## Getting started

### Setup your GPG keys

[GPG](https://gnupg.org/) (GNU Privacy Guard) is an implementation of the 
[OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/) (Pretty Good Privacy) protocol which 
allows to sign and encrypt data or a communication channel. **In this case, 
we use GPG keys to sign commits or tags on GitHub**.

> The idea is to generate a **pair of keys private/public** so we can sign 
> with the private key (which each developer keeps safe) and associate the 
> public key to our GitHub account to verify the signature.
